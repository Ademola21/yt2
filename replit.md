# Video Download API Dashboard

## Overview
This is a full-stack video download and processing application with a React frontend dashboard and Express.js backend API. The application allows users to download videos from various sources (like YouTube), separate video and audio streams, and merge them with custom encoding settings using FFmpeg.

## Purpose
- Generate and manage API keys for accessing the video download service
- Test the video download API with a user-friendly interface  
- Download and merge video content with high-quality audio (libfdk-aac codec)
- Provide API documentation for integration

## Project Architecture

### Frontend (Port 5000)
- **Technology**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Features**:
  - API Key Management tab for generating new API keys
  - API Tester tab for testing video downloads
  - Documentation tab with integration examples
- **Host**: 0.0.0.0 (to support Replit's proxy system)
- **Proxy**: Vite dev server proxies `/v1/*` requests to backend at localhost:4000

### Backend (Port 4000)
- **Technology**: Node.js + Express
- **Host**: localhost
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /v1/keys` - Retrieve all API keys from database
  - `POST /v1/keys` - Generate new API keys (open for development)
  - `POST /v1/formats` - Get available video formats with file sizes (requires API key authentication)
  - `POST /v1/download` - Stream download with instant start (requires API key authentication)
  - `GET /v1/download/progress/:jobId` - Get download progress (polling method)
  - `WebSocket ws://host:port` - Real-time progress updates via WebSocket
- **Database**: SQLite for persistent storage (local.db file)
  - API keys stored in `api_keys` table with automatic timestamps
  - Uses Drizzle ORM for database operations
  - Database file travels with project for easy VPS portability
- **Dependencies**:
  - `yt-dlp` - Python package for downloading videos
  - `ffmpeg-for-homebridge` - Custom FFmpeg build with libfdk-aac support

### Custom FFmpeg
Uses a specialized FFmpeg build from `ffmpeg-for-homebridge` (v2.2.0) that includes:
- libfdk-aac encoder for high-quality HE-AAC audio
- Static build optimized for video processing
- Located at: `node_modules/ffmpeg-for-homebridge/ffmpeg`

## Recent Changes

- **2025-10-27**: Added YouTube cookies integration and real-time progress tracking
  - **YouTube Cookies**: Integrated YouTube cookies for authenticated downloads
    - Supports age-restricted and members-only content
    - Bypasses "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot" restrictions
    - Cookies file stored in `youtube-cookies.txt` (excluded from git)
    - Works with HLS/m3u8 combined formats (SABR streaming)
  - **Instant Download Start**: Complete architecture redesign for instant browser downloads
    - Downloads now start within 2-5 seconds (previously 2+ minutes for large files)
    - yt-dlp streams directly to browser using stdout piping
    - No intermediate server storage during download
    - Uses chunked transfer encoding for immediate response
  - **Real-Time Progress Tracking**: Added WebSocket support for live progress updates
    - WebSocket server on same port as HTTP (port 4000)
    - Clients can subscribe to specific job IDs for progress updates
    - Progress includes: status, percentage, download stage, ETA, file size
    - Broadcasts real-time updates as yt-dlp downloads
  - **Progress Polling API**: Added REST endpoint for progress tracking
    - `GET /v1/download/progress/:jobId` for polling-based monitoring
    - Works with curl, shell scripts, and non-WebSocket clients
    - Job tracking stored in memory with automatic cleanup after 5 minutes
  - **Enhanced API Documentation**: Created comprehensive API_USAGE.md
    - JavaScript examples for WebSocket and fetch API
    - Bash/curl examples for CLI users
    - Browser integration examples
    - Complete API reference with all endpoints

## Recent Changes (Archive)
- **2025-10-24**: Initial setup in Replit environment
  - Configured Vite to use port 5000 with allowedHosts for proxy support
  - Set up backend to use localhost:4000
  - Installed Python 3.11 and yt-dlp for video downloads
  - Configured custom FFmpeg with libfdk-aac support via npm package
  - Updated API endpoints to use relative URLs with Vite proxy
  - Added comprehensive .gitignore for temp files and Python artifacts

- **2025-10-24**: Migrated API key storage to PostgreSQL database
  - Created PostgreSQL database with `api_keys` table
  - Installed Drizzle ORM and Neon serverless database client
  - Updated server.js to use database instead of in-memory storage
  - Added GET /v1/keys endpoint to retrieve all stored API keys
  - Updated ApiKeyManager component to fetch and display keys on mount
  - API keys now persist across server restarts and page navigations

- **2025-10-24**: Fixed workflow stop button issue
  - Created `start.sh` script with proper signal handling
  - Script now properly terminates both backend and frontend processes
  - Replit stop button now correctly stops all servers without leaving orphaned processes
  - No more manual `lsof` and `kill` commands needed

- **2025-10-24**: Migrated from PostgreSQL to SQLite for VPS portability
  - Replaced Neon PostgreSQL with SQLite local database file (`local.db`)
  - Database now travels with project when moving to VPS
  - Removed @neondatabase/serverless dependency, added better-sqlite3
  - Updated Drizzle schema to use SQLite-compatible types
  - All API keys persist in local file for easy portability

- **2025-10-24**: Fixed file size display for video formats
  - Added intelligent file size estimation for merged video+audio files
  - Correctly handles both adaptive formats (video-only) and progressive formats (video+audio)
  - For adaptive formats: Calculates video stream size + audio stream size for accurate merged total
  - For progressive formats: Uses total bitrate which already includes audio
  - When exact filesize unavailable, estimates from bitrate: (bitrate_kbps * 1000 / 8) * duration_seconds
  - File sizes now display accurate estimates instead of "Unknown"

- **2025-10-25**: Upgraded audio encoding to HE-AAC with dynamic filenames and streaming optimization
  - **HE-AAC Encoding**: Changed from AAC LC to HE-AAC (AAC LC SBR) with variable bitrate
    - FFmpeg now uses `-profile:a aac_he` for HE-AAC encoding (codec mp4a-40-5)
    - Enabled variable bitrate mode with `-vbr 2` for optimal quality at ~30kbps
    - Added English language metadata tag for audio stream
    - Audio format now matches: AAC LC SBR, VBR mode, ~30kbps, 44.1kHz
  - **Dynamic Filenames**: Downloads now use actual YouTube video title instead of generic names
    - Fetches video metadata at download start to retrieve title
    - Sanitizes filename to remove filesystem-invalid characters
    - Implements RFC 5987 encoding for Content-Disposition header
    - Supports Unicode characters, emoji, and non-Latin text in filenames
    - Provides ASCII fallback for legacy browser compatibility
  - **Streaming Optimization**: Improved download speed with file streaming
    - Changed from buffered `res.download()` to direct file streaming
    - Uses `fs.createReadStream()` piped to response for immediate transfer start
    - Sets proper HTTP headers (Content-Type, Content-Length, Content-Disposition)
    - Reduces download initiation delay from 20+ seconds to near-instant
    - Maintains proper cleanup on stream completion or error

## Dependencies

### Node.js Packages
- Frontend: react, react-dom, vite, @vitejs/plugin-react, typescript
- Backend: express, cors, dotenv, uuid
- Database: drizzle-orm, drizzle-kit, better-sqlite3
- Video Processing: ffmpeg-for-homebridge

### System Dependencies
- Python 3.11
- yt-dlp (Python package)
- ffmpeg (custom build from ffmpeg-for-homebridge)

### Development Workflow
- Frontend dev server runs on port 5000
- Backend API server runs on port 4000
- Both servers run concurrently via `start.sh` script
- Start script properly handles termination signals for clean shutdowns

## Important Notes
- API keys are stored in SQLite database (`local.db`) and persist across restarts
- Database file is intentionally tracked in git for portability to VPS
- When moving to VPS, simply copy entire project folder with `local.db` included
- Frontend loads existing API keys from database when component mounts
- Temporary video files are stored in `temp/` directory and cleaned up after processing
- The custom FFmpeg is essential for libfdk-aac audio codec support
- Frontend uses Vite proxy to avoid CORS issues during development
- Database schema managed with Drizzle ORM using `npm run db:push` command
- File sizes are calculated to include both video and audio streams for merged downloads
- Estimates account for adaptive (video-only) vs progressive (video+audio) format types
